1. Release Information
======================

  This is a Git development version and has not officially been released. There
  is no guarantee of compatibility or that it will even compile!


  1.1  Reporting Bugs and Known Issues
  ------------------------------------

    Please check the project issue tracker before reporting bugs:

      http://plutocracy.googlecode.com/

    If the issue has not been addressed, you can either attempt to contact the
    development team directly over IRC (#plutocracy on FreeNode) or post a new
    bug report.

    Please read the Issue Tracker Wiki before creating a new issue:

      http://code.google.com/p/plutocracy/wiki/IssueTracker



2. Compiling and Installing Plutocracy
======================================

  Currently Plutocracy is known to work on the following systems:


  2.1  POSIX systems
  ------------------

    On a Debian/Ubuntu system you will need to install the following
    development packages in addition to your normal compiling environment:

      libsdl-dev
      libsdl-pango-dev
      libpng12-dev
      zlib1g-dev
      python

    Plutocracy is packaged with SCons. Compile with:

      $ python setup.py build


  2.2  MacOS X (Darwin)
  ---------------------

    On Darwin you will need to install the latest version of Python and SCons
    first:

      Python      http://www.python.org/download/

    Then install the development ports for the following libraries from
    'c':

      SDL
      SDL_Pango

    Afterwards you should be able to follow the POSIX system instructions
    above to compile.


  2.2  Windows with Visual Studio
  -------------------------------

    Note: With the latest plutocracy, we've suspended updating the Windows
          port due to lack of interest. This information may be outdated.

    The windows\vc8 directory contains a solution and project file setup for
    compiling Plutocracy with Visual Studio 2005. The windows directory
    includes the following SDKs and the project file is already setup to
    use them:

      SDL         http://libsdl.org/
      SDL_ttf     http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
      zlib        http://www.zlib.net/
      libpng      http://www.libpng.org/


  2.2  Windows with MinGW
  -----------------------

    Note: With the latest plutocracy, we've suspended updating the Windows
          port due to lack of interest. This information may be outdated.

    Plutocracy can be compiled for MinGW using SCons. You will need to install
    and setup the following programs:

      Python      http://www.python.org/download/
      MinGW       http://www.mingw.org/download.shtml

    Note that MinGW is required, but MSys is not necessary. You will need to
    configure the PATH environment variable to contain the path of the
    MinGW bin directory:

      1.) Right click on 'My Computer'
      2.) Select 'Properties'
      3.) Select 'Advanced' tab
      4.) Press 'Environment Variables'
      5.) Select 'PATH' in the top listbox
      6.) Press 'Edit'
      7.) Enter the path to the Python, Python Scripts, and MinGW bin
          directories followed by a semicolon before any paths that are
          already there:

            C:\Program Files\Python 2.5;
            C:\Program Files\Python 2.5\Scripts;
            C:\MSys\MinGW\bin;

    You should now be able to open a command prompt, navigate to the
    Plutocracy directory and compile using scons:

      C:\plutocracy> scons mingw=yes

    For additional build targets run scons help:

      C:\plutocracy> scons -h

    Note that after SCons is run for the first time (even if with the -h flag),
    it will create 'custom.py', the configuration file, and draw its options
    from there instead of from the environment. Specify changes over the
    command-line after this point or remove the configuration file.

    Please note that if you are not using version 4 of MinGW GCC, you will need
    to disable percompiled headers:

      C:\plutocracy> scons mingw=yes pch=no



3. Playing Plutocracy
=====================

  TODO



4. Developing for Plutocracy
============================

  The Plutocracy development team welcomes volunteer contributions! Please drop
  by our IRC if you are interested in developing the game:

    #plutocracy on FreeNode

  We welcome work suggestions and always have something to do for programmers,
  graphic and sound effect artists, and musicians.


  4.1  Blender and the PLUM Model Format
  --------------------------------------

    Plutocracy uses a custom model format called PLUM, the "PLUtocracy Model
    format". Current model files are kept in the models subdirectory. You
    will notice that most of these models are gzipped. Because PLUM is a plain
    text format, gzipping the file when it is ready for distribution saves
    space. Plutocracy automatically checks for a gzipped version of a file
    although the non-gzipped version will be loaded instead if it is available.

    While the PLUM format is open and simple enough that a plugin exporter
    could be written for any modelling software suite, we currently only have
    a Python exporter plugin for Blender. On Linux, the file export_plum.py
    needs to be copied (or linked) to your ~/.blender/scripts directory.

    You should now be able to export the current scene via Blender's export
    menu. There are some caveats to using the exporter, please read the usage
    instructions within export_plum.py itself.


  4.2  GoogleCode
  ---------------

    Plutocracy's wiki and bugs are currently hosted on GoogleCode:

        http://plutocracy.googlecode.com/

    The Issue Tracker on this website is the primary means of assigning work
    and tracking bugs (see: 1.1  Reporting Bugs and Known Issues).

    You can get a read-only version of plutocracy from our git repo with:

        git clone git://git.mercenariesguild.net/plutocracy.git

    See the compilation instructions above (2. Compiling and Installing
    Plutocracy) for more information.

    Please note that the SVN repository is no longer being updated, and
    we now use git only.
